# GitHub Repo Single Text Exporter

This Chrome extension downloads the current GitHub repository as a ZIP file, extracts `.py`, `.go`, `.md`, and `.txt` files, and combines them into a single text file. If `README.md` exists it is placed first, followed by the remaining files in alphabetical order.

Click the extension icon while viewing a GitHub repository to download the text file.
